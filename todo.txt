* change Animal chaining in Word Mode 
  - When first item is an Animal, only wild cards and dots of the same color can be connected (and there must be at least 5).
  - Animal 
  - This is too hard. Note that it hard to find a word of length 5, let alone the same color.
  - How about same color and len > 4 OR len > 6
