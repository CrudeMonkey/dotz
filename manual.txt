- Introduction

ice Strength uses ice.

- Modes

-- Dot Mode

* Minimum Chain Length (default: 2) - determines how many dots should be connected at least.

--- Making squares @[tags: ['squares', 'square']]

--- Diagonal Mode

* Determines whether items can be connected diagonally.
* Can't make squares. (Goal: emulate Jelly Splash.)

-- Swap Mode

* Similar to Candy Crush.

-- Word Mode

* In Word Mode dots are replaced with [[Letters]].
* Letters can have a bomb attached, just like a Dot Bomb. We call this a [[Letter Bomb]].
* The following items can be connected to make a word: Letter, Wild Card, Animal, Knight, and Letter Bomb.
* When the first item is an Animal, the word length must be at least 5. The Animal counts as a wild card. The Animal must be the first letter of the word.
* When the first item is a Knight, jump knight-like to the following letters. The knight acts like a wild card.

-- Domino Mode @[tags: ['domino', 'dominoes']]

* To connect two dominoes, the number of pips of the two dominoes of the adjacent sides must be the same.
* When making longer chains, each side of a domino can be used only once. E.g. if a domino with (2,5) is connected to (5,4), you can't connect the (5,4) to e.g. (5,1), because the 5 was already used when connecting to the (2,5) domino. 
* Wild cards can be used to connect unrelated chains.
* The [[Maximum Domino]] option determines the maximum number of pips that will be generated on each side of a domino.

- Click Mode

* Similar to Toy Blast.

- Mode Options

-- Roll Mode

Affects how items fall down. Normally items only falls straight down, and they don't fall off of Rocks.
But in Roll Mode, items can roll sideways off of each other or off Rocks.

-- Minimum Chain Length (default: 2) @[tags: ['minimum chain length']]

* N/A to Swap Mode

-- Mode Indicator

* When playing a level, the Mode Indicator tells you which mode it is.

========================================

- Boosts

Most of the boosts work the same as the associated item.

========================================

- Cells

-- Regular Cell

-- Hole

-- Rock

-- Slide

Slides can not be placed:
* Above/below another slide
* Below a teleport source or rock
* Next to (i.e left or right of) another slide, unless they're back-to-back
* Next to the edge of the grid, such that items would slide out of the grid
* Next to a rock, such that items would slide into the rock

-- Door

A Door is a cell that may hold an item. The item will not be released until the door is opened.

There are 3 types:
* [[Regular Door]] - can be opened on all 4 sides
* [[Directional Door]] - can only be opened on one side
* [[Blinking Door]] - can't be opened

Regular Doors and Directional Doors:
* Can be opened by removing a dot next to it. 
* The [[Door Strength]] indicates how many times it will take to open it.
* Can also be opened by making squares or explosions. These actions reduce their strength, ultimately causing the Door to be removed.
* Can also be opened with Keys, which will open (remove) the Door immediately.

* Directional Doors can optionally rotate clockwise or counter clockwise after each move. This is set with the [[Door Rotation]].
* Blinking Doors can not be damaged or removed, but the item inside can.
* Blinking Doors blink on and off in a specific Sequence.
* A locked Door won't let any items drop thru it, whereas a locked Cage will.

-- Cage

-- Change Color Cell

-- Circuit

-- Conveyer Belt

* A conveyer belt that ends at the edge of the grid, wraps around, and comes in on the opposite side.

-- Lazy Susan

-- Teleport

-- Bubble

-- Ice

* Ice can be removed with explosions or by connecting dots.
* The [[Ice Strength]] determines how many times you need to do this. The darker the ice, the stronger it is.
* Ice can be removed with an Ice Pick.

-- Controller

* A controller may change the state of a cell after each turn.
* E.g Blinking Door, Blinking Cage
* The controller's [[Sequence]] is basically an infinite list of zeroes and ones, where 0 turns a feature off and 1 turns it on.


========================================

- Items

* Most items can be [[stuck]], which prevents them from dropping down.

-- Dot

-- Wild Card

-- Dot Bomb @[tags: ['bomb', 'bombs', 'dot bomb', 'dot bombs']]

* Dots can have a bomb associated with it. 
* The bomb will detonate after a certain number of turns, unless it is removed. When it detonates, the level is lost.
* The [[Bomb Strength]] determines how many turns it tkaes before it detonates.

-- Animal

[[Animal Types]]:
* Default (Random movement)
* Scared
* Follow
* Frozen (Doesn't move)

[[Animal Actions]] - when moving to a new cell:
* Default - leaves colored dots behind
* Swap - simply changes place with the item
* Bombify - changes dots into Dot Bombs

Swap animals have Mickey ears.
Bombify animals have devil horns.

In Word Mode, when the first item is an Animal, the word length must be at least 5. 
The Animal counts as a wild card. The Animal must be the first letter of the word.

-- Anchor

* Drop out at the bottom of the grid.
* Maximum Anchors In Level determines how many anchors can exist at any time.
* Slippery Anchors determines how they roll in Roll Mode

-- Diamond

* Similar to Anchor, except it can't explode or be zapped.
* Drops out at the bottom of the grid.
* Maximum Anchors In Level determines how many diamonds can exist at any time.
* Slippery Anchors determines how they roll in Roll Mode

-- Fire

* Can be extinguished with explosions or by making chains or combos next to it.
* If no fire is extinguished during a turn, fire will grow at the end of the turn.
* The [[Fire Growth Rate]] determines how many fires are added each turn (default: 1 fire per turn.)

-- Laser and Mirror @[tags: ['laser', 'lasers', 'mirror', 'mirrors']]

* The [[Ice Pick]] can be used to remove mirrors.

-- Blocker

-- Clock

* Clocks automatically detonate after a certain number of turns, depending on the [[Clock Strength]]. 
* The hour hand indicates how many turns it will take until it detonates (at 12 o'clock).
* Clocks drop out at the bottom of the grid.
* When clocks are part of the goals, they need to drop out at the bottom of the grid (similar to anchors) before they detonate.

-- Egg

* An Ice Pick can be used to crack an egg.

-- Explody

-- Knight

* In Dot Mode, start a chain with a Knight and jump knight-like to dots of the same color.
* In Swap Mode, swap it with a dot (or wild card) to create a 3-in-a-row combo.
* In Word Mode, start a word with a Knight and jump knight-like to the following letters. The knight acts like a wild card.
* Domino Mode ??
* The [[Knight Strength]] determines how many times you can use (or explode) the knight.

-- Rocket

-- Color Bomb

* In Domino Mode, drag it onto a double (e.g. double six) to remove all dominoes that have that number on at least one side.

-- Striped Dot @[tags: ['striped', 'striped dot', 'striped dots']]

* It's possible to make squares, e.g. connecting the "R" back to itself with "RIPER".
* Colors don't matter, except when a square is made.

========================================

- Level Editor

-- Layout tab

--- Keyboard keys

* Use '+' and '-' to adjust the strength of items (e.g. Animal, Knight, Dot Bomb, Blocker, Clock.)
** If the cell doesn't have one of these items, it will try to adjust the cell.
** The '=' key works as '+' (for your convenience.)
* Use '<' and '>' to adjust the strength of cells (e.g. Door, Cage)
** The ',' and '.' keys work as the '<' and '>' keys (for your convenience.)
* In Word Mode, typing a letter key will change the Letter Dot's letter.
* In Domino Mode, typing 0-9 will change the left or top pips of a domino. Use the shift key to change the right or bottom pips.

--- Cells Mode

Places the selected cell type.
To draw a continuous Conveyer track, simply hold and drag the left mouse button.

--- Items Mode

* Places the selected item when clicking the mouse on the grid.
* Random Item (?) - is filled with a random item by the generator when the level starts. 
** The [[Initial Dots Only]] option determines whether only dots are used initially, or anything that the generator might generate.

--- Special Mode

* [[Place Ice]] - in a Regular Cell using [Ice Strength]
* [[Delete Item]]
* [[Remove Lazy Susan]]
* [[Connect Transporters]]
